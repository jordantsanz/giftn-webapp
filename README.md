This pandemic is stressful enough without holiday shopping! **giftn** is an all-in-one application allowing users to easily track their gift lists, budgeting, and package deliveries. We want to make planning for the COVID-Holidays feel like a breeze!

## Summary
Enter in your budget. Then input the people you're thinking about this holiday season. From there, add gifts to your wishlist for each person, either manually, or using our partnering [Chrome extension](https://github.com/sathvi-k/giftn-chrome-ext). Choose which gifts you decide to buy, and we'll help you stay within your budget! Once you do buy all those gifts, keep your tracking numbers stored in our tracking number hub. With COVID, gift giving might look a little differentâ€”-you may be sending gifts straight to your friends or loved one's houses. With this in mind, you can send an auto-generated email sending your friend or loved one some holiday cheer (along with the tracking number of the package and a personalized message, of course). Get started with **giftn** now!

## Services
This app uses Google authentication and connects to [**giftn's** API](https://github.com/catherinedparnell/giftn-api) where it engages with Google Cloud Firestore database.
